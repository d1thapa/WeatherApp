# WeatherApp
A weather app that will allow users to get real-time, accurate weather data for different locations. 
- This application was built on Android Studio using Java programming language.
- Designed UI using android xml and java language. Established backend using APIs and SQlite database.
- For the appliation, I used Openweathermap to fetch weather data as well as the device's location coordinates.
- Used Volley library to integrate API.
- SQLite database to store data locally and make it available offline.
